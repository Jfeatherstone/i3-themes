# i3 Themes
This is a collection of my i3 themes that I've either created or modified from other users (or more likely, a combination of both). To see dependencies for each specific theme, see its respective README file, as each one may differ.

Just a warning that this has been a learning process, and I would only 100% trust the newest theme bebop, since I was *very* new to shell scripting at the beginning. Just to be safe, I would verify that the install scripts make sense before running them, especially if you do it as root. I will try and update the old stuff as I go, but it's not exactly a priority right now.
